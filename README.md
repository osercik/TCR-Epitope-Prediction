# TCR-Epitope-Prediction
Master Thesis of Statistics and Data Science

Welcome in this folder. Herein, you can find my code (MasterProef.rmd) for my master thesis project.
Official Title: Prediction of T-Cell Receptor Peptide Binding using Machine Learning and Ab Initio Principles.

Note: because of the large size, the data set couldn't be uploaded here. However, the data can be uploaded via the
website of VDJDB. Download the data set there and name it as "VDJDB.tsv". Also note that, since that data base is
being continuously updated, the results might be different that the results reported in the thesis file.

The thesis itself will be updated here after defence (end of June/beginnig of July)

Have fun!
