# TCR-Epitope-Prediction
Master Thesis

Welcome in this folder. Herein, you can find my code (MasterProef.rmd and MasterProef.ipynb) and the data used for my master thesis project.

Official Title: Prediction of T-Cell Receptor Peptide Binding using Machine Learning and Ab Initio Principles.

Note: data can be find in releases. 

Have fun!
